# NMH Roster Generator

A staff management and roster scheduling system for maternity hospitals. This application automates roster generation, ensuring fair and efficient shift allocation based on rules such as full-time/part-time contracts, leave management, and unit-specific restrictions.

## Modular Structure

This project is divided into several core apps, each focusing on a specific functionality:

- **Staff Management**: Handles all staff details, contracts, preferences, and historical data.
- **Roster Generation**: Responsible for creating weekly staff rosters, considering shifts, leave, and weekend rotations.
- **Allocation Engine**: Manages the allocation of staff to specific units, considering gender, training, and rotation rules.
- **Shift Management**: Defines and manages various shift types, ensuring compliance with staff contracts and rest periods.
- **Reporting & Analytics**: Generates reports on staff work history, shift distributions, and compliance with contract hours.
- **Manual Override & Editing**: Allows for manual adjustments and overrides of automatically generated rosters.
- **Notifications & Audit Trail**: Tracks all changes made to rosters and staff records, and sends notifications to staff and managers.
